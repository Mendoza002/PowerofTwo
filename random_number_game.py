"""
This program will serve as a form of entertainment for the user.

A random number will first be selected between 0 and 100.
The user is allowed an unlimited number of guesses to guess the correct number.

If the user guesses a lower amount than the selected number, the program will print to
the user that the guess is "too low."

If the user guesses a higher amount than the selected number, the program will print to
the user that the guess is "too high."

If the user guesses a lower amount than zero or a higher amount than one hundred, the program will print to the user that
the guess is "invalid."

If the user inputs their guess in a word format, the program will print to the user
"You did not enter a number".

Once the user guesses the correct number, the program will print to the user "Correct!"
and will report how many guesses they attempted.
